# Storyline

Laura is just starting her PhD program as part of the [Land-Atmosphere Interaction in Cold Environments](http://www.mn.uio.no/geo/english/research/groups/latice/) (LATICE) project at University of Oslo, Department of Geosciences, Norway. She is interested in exploring
field data from the [Finse Research Centre](http://finse.uio.no). [Finse Alpine Research Center](http://finse.uio.no) is located in the northwestern part of the Hardangervidda mountain plateau and is of great interest for scientists in particular biologists, geologists, geophysicists.

In addition to field data from Finse Research Centre, Laura wishes to use data from other Weather Stations available from [Weather Underground](https://www.wunderground.com/).

A large variety of data is therefore available to her and Laura would like to create the following outputs to better understand her project and show what [Finse Research Centre](http://finse.uio.no) is about:

-  Regularly create a map with temperature values (in dgrees Celcius) from Weather Stations available from Weather Underground in the "Finse" region
-  On the same map, allow users to select the variable to plot (temperature, wind direction, wind speed, relative humidity, pressure, etc.)
- On the same map, allow users to get past data if available
- Get historical data for the same locations (timeseries) where the user can select the start and end date.
- Show plots of the various sensors from Finse Research Centre.
