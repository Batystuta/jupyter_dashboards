# Share your jupyter dashboards online

- Create a github repository to save your jupyter dashboards
- Share your jupyter dashboards in github

# Reproducible computing environments with Binder and GitHub

## A short intro on Binder


## Your jupyter dashboards in mybinder

### Preparing your github repository for Binder

Example with:

- environment.yml
- Dockerfile

### Publish your dashboards in mybinder

- Create a shareable Binder link
- Update your github repository to display shareable Binder link for each of your dashboards

We make two exercises: one with environment.yml (adding conda packages) and one with a Dockerfile (where we add for instance input files).
